# Video Broadcasting Analog Communication System using Vestigial Sideband (VSB)

## 📌 Project Overview
[cite_start]This project involves the development of a VSB-based analog communication system designed for the modulation and demodulation of video signals[cite: 72, 74]. [cite_start]Using **MATLAB**, the system simulates the transmission process by processing video frames, applying modulation techniques, and reconstructing the video at the receiver end[cite: 72, 76].

## 🚀 Key Features
* [cite_start]**Frame Processing**: Extracts and normalizes RGB channels from video frames to prepare for transmission[cite: 75].
* [cite_start]**Modulation & Demodulation**: Implements Vestigial Sideband (VSB) modulation and applies demodulation by multiplying signals with a specific carrier signal[cite: 74, 75].
* [cite_start]**Video Reconstruction**: Reconstructs the video by reshaping demodulated signals and combining them into a final output file[cite: 76].
* [cite_start]**Signal Visualization**: Provides visual analysis of original, modulated, and demodulated signals for every channel to ensure system fidelity[cite: 77].

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
* [cite_start]**Language**: MATLAB[cite: 72].
* [cite_start]**Modulation Scheme**: Vestigial Sideband (VSB)[cite: 74].
* **Core Workflow**:
    1. [cite_start]Extract RGB channels from source video[cite: 75].
    2. [cite_start]Normalize signal levels[cite: 75].
    3. [cite_start]Apply VSB modulation[cite: 74].
    4. [cite_start]Demodulate using carrier signal multiplication[cite: 75].
    5. [cite_start]Reshape and combine signals for final video reconstruction[cite: 76].

## 📊 Results
[cite_start]The system successfully validates the VSB communication model through the visualization of signal transitions and the generation of a reconstructed video file that maintains the integrity of the original source[cite: 76, 77].

## 📅 Project Timeline
* [cite_start]**Completed**: August 2024[cite: 73].
