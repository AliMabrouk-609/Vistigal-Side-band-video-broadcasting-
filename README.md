# Video Broadcasting Analog Communication System using Vestigial Sideband (VSB)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project involves the development of a VSB-based analog communication system designed for the modulation and demodulation of video signals.Using **MATLAB**, the system simulates the transmission process by processing video frames, applying modulation techniques, and reconstructing the video at the receiverend

## 🚀 Key Features
**Frame Processing**: Extracts and normalizes RGB channels from video frames to prepare for transmission.
* **Modulation & Demodulation**: Implements Vestigial Sideband (VSB) modulation and applies demodulation by multiplying signals with a specific carrier signal.
* **Video Reconstruction**: Reconstructs the video by reshaping demodulated signals and combining them into a final output file.
* **Signal Visualization**: Provides visual analysis of original, modulated, and demodulated signals for every channel to ensure system fidelity.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
* **Language**: MATLAB.
* **Modulation Scheme**: Vestigial Sideband (VSB).
* **Core Workflow**:
    1. Extract RGB channels from source video.
    2. Normalize signal levels.
    3. Apply VSB modulation.
    4. Demodulate using carrier signal multiplication.
    5. Reshape and combine signals for final video reconstruction.

## 📊 Results
The system successfully validates the VSB communication model through the visualization of signal transitions and the generation of a reconstructed video file that maintains the integrity of the original source.

## 📅 Project Timeline
**Completed**: August 2024.
